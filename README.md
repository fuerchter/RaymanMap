RaymanMap
=========
## Usage
1. Download this repository. Either Download as ZIP or clone it if you have git.
2. Get [BizHawk](http://tasvideos.org/BizHawk.html). As of now (8th of February 2015) you have to get one of the Interim Build binaries from EmuCR or compile BizHawk yourself to play Rayman. r9060 or higher is preferred.
3. Launch BizHawk, load your Rayman image.
4. Go to Tools -> Lua Console -> Script -> Open Script... and load RaymanMap.lua from the repository.
5. Enter a Level in Rayman and hopefully the Block Types should appear.
